# album-recommendations
Searches through the top 100 of Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, generating results by ranking, year of release, and genre tags. Most of the tags were taken from rateyourmusic.com so use what's on there for the most part, but I also added some more general ones like "rock", "pop", and "hip hop" at my discretion.

All you need to do is download the program and the csv and make sure they're in the same directory, then run the program. The program will also work on any other ranked list of albums that's formatted in the same way; you'd just need to update the filename in the program.
